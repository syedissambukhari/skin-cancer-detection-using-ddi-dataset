# skin-cancer-detection-using-ddi-dataset
A Convolutional neural network (CNN)model to train and detect skin cancer (benign and malignant) disease using DDI(Diverse Dermatology Images)Dataset.
First install all the required libraries.
For Training your own Custom model,Use skin_training.ipynb file.
To detect(predict) any Image open skin_Prediction.ipynb file.
Note:Extract the images_for_prediction.rar file for samples.Changes the directory of image and skin88.h5 model in skin_Prediction.ipynb file for Detection if not the same directory.
